We are adding the additional elements like
Web server(Nginx), Application server, Database , load balancer, server in this design to avoid SPOF single point of failure.

The load balancer is configured with a round-robin algorithm for distributing connections evenly across the machines.

The load balancer is enabling an Active-Passive setup that is, the load balancer recognizes a failed node and then redirects its traffic to the available node and for the active-active its spreads out the traffic among multiple nodes.

Database primary replica works by involving one or more applications thats connects a primary storage location and a secondary location.

Issues with the infrastructure:

There are no SPOF
On security issues there are no https and firewalls to secure infrastructure and they are no monitoring.
